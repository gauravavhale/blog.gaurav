          <h1>📖 Dear Diary</h1>
          <h2>There are moments in life that never make it to social media, 
              but they live deeply in our memories — quiet thoughts, small victories, 
              little disappointments, and everything in between. 
              This space is for those moments.
          </h2>
          <h2>
              I never imagined I’d end up writing a diary on a blog, but 
              here I am sharing a slice of my real, unfiltered life. No fancy edits, no polished updates. 
              Just raw thoughts and honest reflections.

          <h1>🌱 Where I Started</h1>
          <h2>I was born and raised in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar 
              a quiet, observant kid who mostly kept to himself, 
              surrounded by a few close friends and a head full of dreams. 
              Growing up, I believed that if I followed the usual path, 
              everything would fall into place.
              But somewhere along the way, life started unfolding differently than I had imagined.
          </h2>
          <h2>There was a phase when nothing seemed to align with my plans. 
              I felt stuck like I had missed the train everyone else seemed to be on. 
              It was frustrating, disheartening, and honestly, a little scary.
              But sometimes, it's when you feel completely lost that you start discovering who you truly are.

          <h1>🔄 Turning Point</h1>
          <div>
            During the lockdown, everything slowed down — including my thoughts and plans. 
            I had a lot of time on my hands, but no clear idea of what to do next. 
            It felt like I was just passing the days, hoping something would change on its own.
          </div>
          <div>
            After graduating in 2022, something inside me shifted. 
            I started thinking deeply about where I was heading. That’s when I realized 
            a career in tech doesn’t always need a fancy degree. 
            What it really needs is curiosity, effort, and the willingness to keep going, even when things get tough.
            So, I decided to go all in.

          <h1>💻 Rebuilding Myself</h1>
          <div>
            Starting from scratch was overwhelming at first. 
            I didn’t come from a tech background, and everything felt new 
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node… it was a whole different world. 
            But I was curious, and that curiosity pushed me forward.
          </div>
          <div>
            In my MERN stack classes, I learned step by step how the web works, 
            how frontend connects to backend, and how to build something that actually runs. 
            I still remember how excited I was when my first project worked without errors. 
            It was a small achievement, but it gave me a huge confidence boost.
          </div>
          <div>
            Over time, I built more projects — from portfolios to a fully working e-commerce app. 
            With each one, I not only improved my skills but also proved to myself that I could do this.
            Now, when I look back at where I started, I feel proud. 
            I may not have taken the usual route, but I built my foundation brick by brick 
            with patience, persistence, and a lot of Google searches.

          <h1>💭 What’s Next?</h1>
          <div>
            I'm currently applying for developer roles and internships. 
            I won’t pretend it’s easy — the rejections can hurt, and self-doubt sometimes creeps in. 
            But I’ve come too far to stop now.
          </div>
          <div>
            This diary will continue as my journey continues 
            whether it's my first job offer, a failed interview, a trip I loved, 
            or just a random thought on a sleepless night.

        <div>
          <h1>Rejections That Taught Me More Than Books</h1>
          <div>
            I’ve applied to dozens of jobs and internships. 
            Some never responded, others sent rejections. At first, it crushed me. 
            But then I realized — each “no” made me refine my resume, my portfolio, my code. 
            And every rejection pushed me one step closer to that one yes I’m still chasing.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h1>My Personal Blog Is Live!</h1>
          <div>
            The blog you’re reading now is something I’m really proud of. 
            It's not just a project — it’s my personal space, built with love, lines of code, 
            and stories from my journey. I hope it inspires someone out there who’s still figuring things out.
